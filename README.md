About Me
--------------
I do have experience in game development using **Godot, Unity (C#), and Unreal (C++)**. Keeping a strong emphasis on writing clean and maintainable code. 
When it comes to troubleshooting and fixing bugs, I am very patient and persistent. My focus is on Gameplay, Ai and Multiplayer development. 
<br>
<br>
Growing up during the heyday of Beat'Em Up games and handheld consoles with limited buttons like 'A and B', my passion for gaming has remained constant. 
I have a vast collection of over 450 games, and my love for playing and collecting games continues to expand.

Since October 2023 I finished my studies at the School For Games in Berlin. Where I was primarily working as a **Gameplay and AI Programmer** <br> 
while collaborating closely with Game Designers and Artists. My resposibilites involved implementing **Player and NPC locomotion, 3D models,<br> 
Audio-Visual Effects, Camera Setup and taking care of a clean overall project structure and maintaining our version control with Perforce, TortoiseHG and Git**.

While Linux may not be the most popular choice for game development, I am committed to putting in the extra effort to ensure Unity or Unreal can be set up and used effectively on the platform. 
**All of my projects have been developed on Linux**, and I am dedicated to deploying games for different operating systems.
