### About Me

**Making games — because they made me.**

I had the privilege of growing up during the golden age of gaming — from *Leatherneck* on the Amiga to <br>*Super Mario Land* on the Game Boy, *Zelda: A Link to the Past*, *Street Fighter II Turbo*, *Super Double Dragon*, <br> and all the way up to the Wii U. 

Later came the PC era: *Warcraft*, *GTA*, *Max Payne* — different worlds, same spark. And that spark never left.

When I started coding, I naturally focused on the things that mattered to me most as a player —<br> 
gameplay systems, AI behavior, script communication, game feel, and multiplayer. 
<br>I wanted to comprehend how games *move*, *react*, and *feel alive*.

I work with **Linux** as my primary OS (since 2018) and use the tools that get the job done:
- **Godot** — fast, open-source, team-friendly, fully cross-platform  
- **Unreal Engine** — for scale, performance, and deep systems  
- **Unity** — when the project fits the tool

I aim for clean, player-focused code — but fixing bugs is how I get closer to it.  
I’ve learned more from breaking things and putting them back together than any tutorial ever taught me.

That’s the loop: **build, break, learn, iterate**.

I’ve taken part in game jams and worked with artists who already made beauty, <br>
helping create an interactive version of it — **something you can see, feel, and play.**

I’m drawn to complexity — I see how everything is connected, communicates, and serves a larger design.  
But I’ve had to learn — the hard way — that sometimes, the smallest system is the right one.  
Still training myself to think ***simple, efficient, effective*** — and it shows, especially during game jams.
