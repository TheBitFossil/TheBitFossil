About Me
--------------
Developing games with **Godot, C# (Unity) or C++ (Unreal)**, with a strong emphasis on keeping my code clean and maintainable.
Self-motivated and quick to learn new engines or tools and very patient when it comes to bugfixing. <br>
<br>
I grew up during the early days of gaming when Beat'Em Ups dominated the market and handhelds only used 'A and B'. <br>
Since then i have never stopped playing, loving and collecting games and my main library contains over 400 games and growing. <br>
<br>
During the last **2 years** I was mainly working as **Gameplay|AI Programmer** collaborating with Game Designers and Artists. <br>
Implemented player or npc locomotions, 3D models, audio- or visual-effects, responsible for the general project structure <br> 
and onboarding with version control **(Perforce, TurtoiseHG)**.<br>
<br>
Linux is not for everyone but it can be, so I am taking the extra effort to get Unity or Unreal up and running. <br>
Because all projects where **made on Linux** and I am dedicated to deploy for the different operating systems. <br>
