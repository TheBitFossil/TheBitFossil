About Me
--------------
🎮 With experience in game development using Godot, Unity (C#), and Unreal Engine (C++), I prioritize writing clean and maintainable code. I thrive in troubleshooting and fixing bugs, leveraging patience and persistence to overcome challenges, with a focus on Gameplay, AI, and Multiplayer development.

🕹️ Growing up during the heyday of Beat'Em Up games and handheld consoles with limited buttons like 'A and B', my passion for gaming has remained constant. I have a vast collection of over 450 games, and my love for playing and collecting games continues to expand.

🎓 Since October 2023, I have completed my studies at the School for Games in Berlin, where I primarily worked as a Gameplay and AI Programmer. Collaborating closely with Game Designers and Artists, my responsibilities included implementing Player and NPC locomotion, 3D models, Audio-Visual Effects, Camera Setup, and maintaining a clean overall project structure. I also managed version control using Perforce, TortoiseHG, and Git.

💻 While Linux may not be the most popular choice for game development, I am committed to ensuring Unity or Unreal can be set up and used effectively on the platform. All of my projects have been developed on Linux, and I am dedicated to deploying games for different operating systems.
