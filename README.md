About Me
--------------
I have experience in game development using **Godot, Unity (C#), and Unreal (C++)**, with a strong emphasis on writing clean and maintainable code. 
I am self-motivated, eager to learn new engines and tools, and demonstrate patience when it comes to troubleshooting and fixing bugs.
<br>
<br>
Growing up during the heyday of Beat'Em Up games and handheld consoles with limited buttons like 'A and B', my passion for gaming has remained constant. 
I have a vast collection of over 400 games, and my love for playing and collecting games continues to expand.

For the past two years, I have primarily worked as a **Gameplay and AI Programmer**, collaborating closely with Game Designers and Artists. In this role, 
I have implemented **player and NPC locomotion, 3D models, audio-visual effects, and have been responsible for the overall project structure**. 
Additionally, I have experience with version control systems such as **Perforce and TortoiseHG**.

While Linux may not be the most popular choice for game development, I am committed to putting in the extra effort to ensure Unity or Unreal can be set up and used effectively on the platform. **All of my projects have been developed on Linux**, and I am dedicated to deploying games on different operating systems.
