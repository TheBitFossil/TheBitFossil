ðŸ’» Full-Time Game Engineering Student at the School For Games in Berlin ðŸ’»
</h2> 

I grew up with the early days of gaming. When Beat'Em Ups dominated the market and handhelds only used A and B for Input.\
Since then i have never stopped playing, loving and collecting games. My bigest library contains over 400 games and is still growing.\
\
Over the last 30yrs my love for games grew to an extend that "playing" is not enough now i am passionately making them.\
Actively enjoying to share my experiences with others, inspiring, giving valueable feedback as a beta tester or working on my own projects.\
\
For me there is nothing better as to work in a team that shares the same goals and is driven by the same motivation.\
Facing the everyday challenges of game development, is rewarded by something truly special and i am thankful for every lesson.\
